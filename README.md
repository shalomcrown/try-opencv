# try-opencv
This is a test progrm for OpenCV's Java bindings.
It is currently set to use Ubuntu's built-in OpenCV package.
Thanks to http://techslides.com/sample-webm-ogg-and-mp4-video-files-for-html5 for the sample video file.

Three panels are shown, one with /dev/video0, one with direct input of the file, and one with input from UDP, which is fed by an external FFMPEG process
